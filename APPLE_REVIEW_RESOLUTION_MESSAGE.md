# Apple App Review - Issue Resolution Message

## Subject: Ray Club App - Login/Registration Issue Resolved (Version 1.0.15 Build 24)

---

**Dear Apple App Review Team,**

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide an update regarding the login and registration issues that were identified during the review process of our Ray Club App.

## Issue Resolution Summary

We have successfully identified and resolved the root cause of the authentication problems that were preventing new users from completing the registration process and logging into the application.

### Root Cause Analysis
After thorough investigation, we discovered that the issue was located in a database function that was missing a critical parameter. This missing parameter was causing:
- New user registrations to fail silently
- Authentication processes to not complete properly
- Users being unable to access the application after attempting to sign up

### Technical Resolution
- **Fixed**: Database function now includes all required parameters
- **Tested**: Registration and login flows have been thoroughly tested with new users
- **Verified**: Both Apple Sign-In and Google Sign-In are working correctly
- **Validated**: User authentication is now completing successfully

### Version Information
- **App Version**: 1.0.15
- **Build Number**: 24
- **Bundle ID**: com.rayclub.app

## Quality Assurance
We have conducted extensive testing to ensure:
1. New users can successfully register using Apple Sign-In
2. New users can successfully register using Google Sign-In
3. Existing users can log in without issues
4. All authentication flows complete properly
5. User data is correctly stored and retrieved

## Request for Re-Review
We kindly request that you re-review our application with this updated version (1.0.15 Build 24). The authentication issues that were previously identified have been completely resolved.

## Appreciation
We sincerely appreciate your patience and thorough review process. Your feedback was instrumental in helping us identify and resolve this critical issue, which ultimately improves the user experience for our customers.

We understand the importance of providing a seamless and reliable user experience, and we are committed to maintaining the high standards expected by Apple and our users.

## Next Steps
We eagerly await your response and the opportunity to have our app approved for distribution on the App Store. If you need any additional information or have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
