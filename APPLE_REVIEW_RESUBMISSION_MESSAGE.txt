Dear Apple Review Team,

Thank you for your patience and thorough review of Ray Club App.

We are resubmitting our application with all external payment links removed. We want to clarify that Ray Club App is completely free to use - there are no paid features, subscriptions, or in-app purchases.

Our app operates on a progressive unlock system where users gain access to additional content and features as they engage with the app and complete activities. This gamification approach is designed to encourage healthy habits and user engagement, not to generate revenue through payments.

Key points about our app:
• 100% free application with no monetization
• No external payment links or references to paid content
• Features unlock based on user progress and activity completion
• No subscription model or in-app purchase system
• All content is available to users through engagement and progression

We have carefully reviewed and removed any content that could be interpreted as directing users to external payment systems. The app now focuses purely on the fitness and wellness experience we aim to provide to our users.

We appreciate your time and consideration in reviewing our application. Please let us know if you need any additional information or clarification.

Thank you for your patience throughout this process.

Best regards,
Ray Club Development Team
