Dear Apple App Review Team,

We have successfully resolved the login/registration issues identified in our previous submission.

ROOT CAUSE: The problem was caused by a missing parameter in a database function, which prevented new user registrations from completing and users from being properly authenticated.

RESOLUTION: We have fixed the database function to include all required parameters. Both Apple Sign-In and Google Sign-In now work correctly for new users.

TESTING: We have thoroughly tested the registration and login flows with new users to ensure the issue is completely resolved.

VERSION: 1.0.15 (Build 24)

We sincerely appreciate your patience and thorough review process. Your feedback was instrumental in helping us identify and resolve this critical issue.

We eagerly await your response and the opportunity to have our app approved for distribution on the App Store.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ray Club Development Team
